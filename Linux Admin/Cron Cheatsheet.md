# Cron Cheatsheet



### traditional cron

* [suppress mail](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/100722/how-do-i-completely-silence-a-cronjob-to-dev-null)

* [useful crontab site](https://crontab.guru)
	* assists in creating the time portion of the command




### file modification cron
* `apt install incron`
	* incron handles filesystem events rather than time periods
