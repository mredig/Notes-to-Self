# Command Cheatsheet

Not intended for the most common commands, but ones that are used slightly less often, yet still quite useful.

* List file and folder usage sorted
	* `df -h -d 1 / | sort -h`
	* on Mac, need to install `brew install coreutils` and run `df -h -d 1 / | gsort -h`
* List disk usage
	* `du -h`
